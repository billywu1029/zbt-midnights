Implementation of the algorithm for ZBT midnights (AKA our system for doing chores throughout our fraternity house).
Uses the max flow code developed in this directory + input preferences + midnights structure to setup a Flow Network
and then use Ford Fulkerson to find the max flow (and obviously find the optimal midnights assignment for the week).
